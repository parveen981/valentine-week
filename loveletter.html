                From the moment you stepped into my life, everything became magical.  
                Your smile is my sunshine, your voice is my favorite melody,  
                and your presence makes every day feel like a dream.  
                Though life may take us on different journeys,  
                my heart will always beat with love for you.  
                <br><br>
                No matter where we go, you will always have a special place in my heart.  
                <br><br>
                **Forever cherishing you,**  
                <br>
                ❤️ **Your Special One** ❤️
